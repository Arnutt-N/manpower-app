# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent Chat Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-agent-chat`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Next.js application following @manpower-app.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Chat Conversation (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to have a natural text conversation with an AI assistant so that I can get quick answers to general questions.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational MVP feature. Without basic chat functionality, no other agent capabilities can be demonstrated or tested. It provides immediate value and validates the core LLM integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the chat interface, sending a message like "Hello, how are you?", and receiving a coherent AI response. Delivers standalone conversational value without requiring any other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the chat page, **When** I type "What is TypeScript?" and press send, **Then** I receive a relevant, well-formatted response about TypeScript
2. **Given** I have sent multiple messages, **When** I send a follow-up question that references previous context, **Then** the AI maintains conversation continuity and provides contextually relevant answers
3. **Given** I am in an active conversation, **When** I send a new message, **Then** I see the AI's response streaming in real-time (token by token)
4. **Given** the AI is generating a response, **When** the response contains multiple paragraphs, **Then** each paragraph streams smoothly without UI glitches
5. **Given** I refresh the page, **When** I return to the chat, **Then** my previous conversation history is preserved and displayed

### User Story 2 - Knowledge-Based Questions with RAG (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want the AI to answer questions about specific documents or knowledge bases, so that I can get accurate information from custom data sources rather than just the LLM's training data.

**Why this priority**: RAG capabilities differentiate this from basic chatbots and enable domain-specific applications. However, it requires basic chat (P1) to be functional first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by ingesting sample documents (e.g., product documentation), asking "What features does Product X have?", and verifying the AI retrieves and references the specific document content in its answer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** documents have been ingested into the knowledge base, **When** I ask "What is mentioned about [specific topic] in the documentation?", **Then** the AI retrieves relevant document chunks and provides an answer with citations
2. **Given** I ask a question that requires document context, **When** the RAG agent processes my query, **Then** I see an indicator showing "Searching knowledge base..." before the answer streams
3. **Given** no relevant documents exist for my question, **When** I ask an off-topic question, **Then** the AI gracefully indicates that the information isn't in the knowledge base and offers a general response
4. **Given** multiple documents contain related information, **When** I ask a broad question, **Then** the AI synthesizes information from multiple sources coherently
5. **Given** I ask a follow-up question about a document, **When** the conversation continues, **Then** the RAG system maintains context and can reference previously retrieved information

### User Story 3 - Tool Execution for Actions (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the AI to perform actions like checking the weather or getting system information, so that I can accomplish tasks beyond just getting conversational answers.

**Why this priority**: Tool calling adds practical utility but depends on the routing system being stable (which requires P1 and P2 to be solid). It's valuable but not essential for initial MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking "What's the weather in San Francisco?" and verifying the AI calls the weather tool, retrieves real data, and presents it in a user-friendly format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I ask "What's the current time?", **When** the AI determines a tool is needed, **Then** it executes the `get_system_time` tool and responds with the current time
2. **Given** I ask "What's the weather in New York?", **When** the tool agent processes the request, **Then** it calls the `get_current_weather` tool with "New York" as the parameter and returns formatted weather data
3. **Given** the AI needs to use a tool, **When** the tool is executing, **Then** I see a status indicator like "Checking weather..." to inform me of the action
4. **Given** a tool execution fails (API error), **When** the error occurs, **Then** the AI gracefully handles it and informs me that it couldn't complete the action
5. **Given** I ask a question requiring multiple tool calls, **When** the AI processes my request, **Then** it orchestrates the tools in sequence and synthesizes a comprehensive answer

---

### User Story 4 - MCP File System Operations (Priority: P4)

As a user, I want the AI to read files from my system via MCP protocol, so that I can ask questions about local file contents without manually copying and pasting.

**Why this priority**: MCP integration is advanced functionality that showcases cutting-edge capabilities but isn't essential for core value delivery. It requires all previous layers to be stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running an MCP filesystem server, asking "What's in the file /tmp/example.txt?", and verifying the AI connects to MCP, reads the file, and returns its contents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an MCP filesystem server is running, **When** I ask "Read the file at /tmp/notes.txt", **Then** the AI connects to MCP, retrieves the file content, and displays it
2. **Given** I ask about a file that doesn't exist, **When** the MCP tool executes, **Then** the AI handles the error gracefully and informs me the file wasn't found
3. **Given** I ask "Summarize the file /documents/report.pdf", **When** the MCP integration retrieves the file, **Then** the AI reads the content and provides a concise summary
4. **Given** the MCP server is unavailable, **When** I try to use MCP tools, **Then** the system falls back gracefully and informs me that file operations are currently unavailable
5. **Given** I request access to a restricted file path, **When** the MCP server denies access, **Then** the AI informs me that access was denied for security reasons

### User Story 5 - Session Management and Persistence (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want my conversation to persist across page refreshes and browser sessions, so that I can continue conversations without losing context.

**Why this priority**: Memory persistence is critical for real-world usability and elevates the application from a demo to a practical tool. It's tightly coupled with P1 (basic chat) and should be implemented early.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a conversation, refreshing the page, and verifying that all previous messages are still visible and the AI remembers the conversation context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an active conversation with a unique session ID, **When** I refresh the browser, **Then** the entire conversation history is restored exactly as it was
2. **Given** I close the browser and return later, **When** I navigate to the same session, **Then** the conversation continues from where I left off
3. **Given** I start a new session, **When** I send my first message, **Then** a unique session ID is generated and stored
4. **Given** multiple users are using the system, **When** each user has their own session ID, **Then** conversations remain isolated and private to each session
5. **Given** the system is under load, **When** I send a message, **Then** state saving/loading operations don't cause noticeable latency (< 200ms)

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when the GLM-4.6 API is down or rate-limited?**
  System should detect API failures, show a user-friendly error message, and suggest retrying later. Previously saved conversation history should remain intact.

- **What happens when the user sends extremely long messages (> 10,000 characters)?**
  System should validate input length, show a warning if too long, and truncate or reject messages exceeding limits.

- **What happens when concurrent users exceed database connection limits?**
  System should implement connection pooling and gracefully handle connection exhaustion with proper error messages.

- **What happens when the vector database (ChromaDB) is empty or corrupted?**
  RAG agent should detect empty/corrupted state, fallback to general chat mode, and log errors for debugging.

- **What happens when network latency causes SSE connection drops?**
  Frontend should detect disconnections, attempt to reconnect automatically, and show connection status to the user.

- **What happens when a user sends malicious input (XSS, SQL injection attempts)?**
  All user inputs must be sanitized server-side before processing. Security vulnerabilities should be blocked at the API layer.

- **What happens when the router agent makes incorrect routing decisions?**
  System should log routing decisions for analysis. If RAG/tool agents fail, fallback to basic chat agent.

- **What happens when tools return malformed or unexpected data?**
  Tool execution layer should validate responses and handle errors gracefully, informing the user of issues.
