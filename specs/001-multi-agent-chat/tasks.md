# Tasks: Multi-Agent Chat Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-multi-agent-chat/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per constitution (TDD principle). E2E tests for P1 are mandatory before merge.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP blocker
- **User Story 5 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 - Tightly coupled with chat functionality
- **User Story 2 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run in parallel with US5 if staffed
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run after US1
- **User Story 4 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US3 (tool agent infrastructure) - Optional/Advanced
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Independence

- **US1 (P1)**: Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **US5 (P2)**: Extends US1 with persistence - Independent testable (can chat without US2/US3/US4) ‚úÖ
- **US2 (P2)**: Adds RAG - Independent testable (can retrieve docs without US3/US4) ‚úÖ
- **US3 (P3)**: Adds tools - Independent testable (can execute tools without US2/US4) ‚úÖ
- **US4 (P4)**: Adds MCP - Independent testable (can read files without US2/US3) ‚úÖ

### Within Each User Story

1. **Tests FIRST** (Red phase) - Write failing tests
2. **Get approval** - Ensure tests reflect requirements
3. **Implementation** (Green phase) - Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Refactor** - Clean up while maintaining test coverage
5. **Checkpoint validation** - Test story independently

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003-T012 can run in parallel (all marked [P])

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T014-T015, T017, T019-T021 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 3 (US1 Tests)**: Tasks T022-T024 can run in parallel (different test files)

**Phase 3 (US1 Implementation)**: Tasks T027-T028, T031-T032 can run in parallel

**Once Foundational completes**: US1, US2 (if US1 done), US3 (if US1 done) can be worked on by different team members in parallel

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: Tasks T085-T090, T094-T095, T097-T098 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch foundational tasks together:
Task T014: "Define Session types in src/lib/types/session.ts"
Task T015: "Define AgentState types in src/lib/types/agent.ts"
Task T017: "Create formatting utilities in src/utils/formatting.ts"
Task T019: "Create Button component in src/components/ui/Button.tsx"
Task T020: "Create Input component in src/components/ui/Input.tsx"
Task T021: "Create Spinner component in src/components/ui/Spinner.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 5 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T012)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T013-T021) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T022-T041) - Basic chat with streaming
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 5 (T042-T051) - Session persistence
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US5 independently, run E2E test (T026)
6. Deploy to staging/demo

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational + US1 + US5 ‚Üí MVP with persistent chat ‚úÖ
2. **Sprint 2**: Add US2 (RAG) ‚Üí Deploy chat with knowledge retrieval ‚úÖ
3. **Sprint 3**: Add US3 (Tools) ‚Üí Deploy chat with actions ‚úÖ
4. **Sprint 4**: Add US4 (MCP) if needed ‚Üí Deploy advanced file operations ‚úÖ
5. **Sprint 5**: Polish (Phase 8) ‚Üí Production-ready release ‚úÖ

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers:

1. **Sprint 1**: All developers work on Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 together (foundational work)
2. **Sprint 2**: Once US1 complete:
   - Developer A: US5 (Session persistence)
   - Developer B: US2 (RAG pipeline)
   - Developer C: Write additional tests, documentation
3. **Sprint 3**:
   - Developer A: US3 (Tools)
   - Developer B: US4 (MCP - if time permits)
   - Developer C: Performance optimization, security audit
4. **Sprint 4**: All developers work on Polish phase together

## Test-First Workflow (TDD)

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

For each user story:

1. **Red Phase** ‚úÖ:
   - Write unit tests (should FAIL)
   - Write integration tests (should FAIL)
   - Get stakeholder approval on test scenarios
   - Commit failing tests

2. **Green Phase** ‚úÖ:
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Run tests repeatedly until all pass
   - Commit passing implementation

3. **Refactor Phase** ‚úÖ:
   - Clean up code (remove duplication, improve readability)
   - Ensure tests still pass
   - Commit refactored code

### Example: User Story 1 (Basic Chat)

```bash
# Red Phase
git checkout -b us1-tests
# Write T022-T026 (all tests fail initially)
git commit -m "test(us1): Add failing tests for basic chat"
# Get approval from stakeholder on test scenarios

# Green Phase
git checkout -b us1-implementation
# Implement T027-T041 (minimal code to pass tests)
# Run: npm run test -- --testPathPattern="chat" (using Vitest)
git commit -m "feat(us1): Implement basic chat with streaming"

# Refactor Phase
# Clean up code, extract utilities, improve naming
# Run: npm run test (ensure all tests still pass with Vitest)
git commit -m "refactor(us1): Clean up chat implementation"
```

---

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD Mandatory**: Write tests first, ensure they fail, get approval, then implement
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution compliance: ‚â•80% unit test coverage, ‚â•70% integration test coverage, E2E for P1 mandatory
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Checkpoints Summary

- ‚úÖ **After T021**: Foundation ready - all user stories can begin
- ‚úÖ **After T041**: US1 (Basic Chat) complete - MVP testable
- ‚úÖ **After T051**: US5 (Persistence) complete - Chat survives refreshes
- ‚úÖ **After T064**: US2 (RAG) complete - Knowledge retrieval works
- ‚úÖ **After T075**: US3 (Tools) complete - Action execution works
- ‚úÖ **After T084**: US4 (MCP) complete - File operations work
- ‚úÖ **After T100**: All features polished - Production ready

Each checkpoint should trigger independent testing and validation of the completed story before proceeding.
